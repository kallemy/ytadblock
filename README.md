Youtube Companion extension for Chrome

As Youtube has prevented the use of most common ad blockers, here's a new one made just for YouTube.
It's a Chrome extension that skips video ads instantaneously and hides static page ads. 

Also added a "Show only new videos" button to load all videos, remove all videos older than 1 day, remove shorts, mixes, ads, promo, remove videos you've already watched and then rearrange videos so you have only fresh videos in the home page. Renamed the package to Youtube Companion.

Works in English and Finnish language settings.

To install just 
1. Download the files to a folder
2. Go to Chrome - Extensions - Manage Extensions
3. Enable "Developer Mode" on the upper right corner
4. Click on "Load Unpacked" and select the folder with "manifest.json"
5. Refresh Youtube
