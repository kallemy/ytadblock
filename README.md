Youtube ad blocker extension for Chrome

As Youtube has prevented the use of most common ad blockers, here's a new one made just for YouTube.
It's a Chrome extension that skips video ads instantaneously and hides static page ads. 

To install just 
1. Download the files to a folder
2. Go to Chrome - Extensions - Manage Extensions
3. Enable "Developer Mode" on the upper right corner
4. Click on "Load Unpacked" and select the folder with "manifest.json"
5. Refresh Youtube
